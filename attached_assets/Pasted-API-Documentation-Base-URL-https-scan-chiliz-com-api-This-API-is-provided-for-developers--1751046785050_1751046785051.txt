Account ?module=account
Mimics Ethereum JSON RPC's eth_getBalance. Returns the balance as of the provided block (defaults to latest)
?module=account&action=eth_get_balance&address={addressHash}
eth_get_balance

GET
POST
More Details
Get balance for address. Also available through a GraphQL 'addresses' query. If the balance hasn't been updated in a long time, we will double check with the node to fetch the absolute latest balance. This will not be reflected in the current request, but once it is updated, subsequent requests will show the updated balance. If you want to know whether or not we are checking for another balance, use the balancemulti action. That contains a property called stale that will let you know to recheck that balance in the near future.
?module=account&action=balance&address={addressHash}
balance

GET
POST
More Details
Get balance for multiple addresses. Also available through a GraphQL 'addresses' query. If the balance hasn't been updated in a long time, we will double check with the node to fetch the absolute latest balance. This will not be reflected in the current request, but once it is updated, subsequent requests will show the updated balance. You can know that this is taking place via the stale attribute, which is set to true if a new balance is being fetched.
